# Bukkit Helper
This is a python script that helps you administer a bukkit server.
The updating uses [bukkit's api](http://dl.bukkit.org/about/#apiDocumentation) so you know it's always going to be the newest.
In the code you can change the channel you would like to use (stable, beta, or development).

# Usage
This expects that the script is located in the root directory of your bukkit server.

## Run
1. `python bukkithelper.py run`

## Update
1. Make sure bukkit is not running
1. Run `python bukkithelper.py update`
1. Wait until finished downloading
